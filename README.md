I am sharing here solutions to coding interview problems as I train for these interviews. Some of the solutions are not mine. Please feel free to have a look and message me if you have any comment or if you would like to suggest an improvement concerning a particular solution. Of course, please feel free to use this as a resource for your own interview preparation.

Essential algorithms for interviews:
 - recursive & iterative linked list reversal (e.g., [leetcode 206: reverse linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) [[code]](Leetcode/Linked_list/206_reverse_linked_list.py) [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_I-ZF0S38))
 - iterative depth first search in a binary tree (e.g., [leetcode 104: max depth of binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) [[code]](Leetcode/Trees/104_max_depth_of_binary_tree.py) [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTM3phVI6YQ))
 - recursive depth first search in a binary tree (e.g., [leetcode 104: max depth of binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) [[code]](Leetcode/Trees/104_max_depth_of_binary_tree.py) [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTM3phVI6YQ))
 - breath-first search in a binary tree (e.g., [leetcode 104: max depth of binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) [[code]](Leetcode/Trees/104_max_depth_of_binary_tree.py) [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTM3phVI6YQ))
 - binary search (e.g., [Leetcode 278: first bad version](Leetcode/Sorting_and_searching/278_first_bad_version.py))

Non-essential but interesting algorithms:
